# Code Cleanup Summary

This document summarizes the code cleanup performed on the Compiler project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Unused Files
- `api_urls.py` - This file was completely commented out and not referenced anywhere in the project.
- `middleware.py` - This file was empty and not used.

### 2. Database Model Improvements
- Consolidated `SubmissionHistory` model into `UserSubmission` by adding an `is_history` flag.
  - This simplifies the database schema while preserving functionality.
  - Reduces redundant code and database tables.

### 3. Enhanced Existing Models
- Added improved methods to `StarterCode` model:
  - `get_code()` now properly handles case-insensitive language names
  - Added `has_code_for_language()` helper method to check if code is available

### 4. MongoDB Connection Optimization
- Consolidated MongoDB connection code
- Reduced duplication between `DB/db.py` and `mongo.py`
- Now both files use a single connection instance

## Important Note
The code runner modules (`code_runner2.py` and `code_runner3.py`) were preserved intact as they serve important functions:
- `code_runner2.py` - Handles cloud-based code execution
- `code_runner3.py` - Manages local Docker container code execution

## Migration Instructions
A migration file (`0014_remove_submissionhistory_add_ishistory.py`) has been created to handle the database schema changes.

To apply these changes to your database, run:
```
python manage.py migrate
```
